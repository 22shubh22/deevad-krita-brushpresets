## Compatibility :

Brush presets to use with the open-source digital painting software Krita.
The brush under V6 are compatible with Krita under 2.9: but breaks behavior after 2.9. 
To fix it's simple but long: remove the 'flow dynamic' preset by preset and overwrite. 
The brush after V6 are compatible with Krita 2.9 (and hopefully future versions)
